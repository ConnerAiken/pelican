You cant use this. For anything. 

## Context

When one makes a creative work (which includes code), the work is under exclusive copyright by default. Unless one include a license that specifies otherwise, nobody else can copy, distribute, or modify one's work without being at risk of take-downs, shake-downs, or litigation.

Even in the absence of a license file, one may grant some rights in cases where one publish oner source code to a site that requires accepting terms of service. For example, if one publish oner source code in a public repository on GitHub, one have accepted the Terms of Service, by which one allow others to view and fork oner repository. Others may not need oner permission if limitations and exceptions to copyright apply to their particular situation. Neither site terms nor jurisdiction-specific copyright limitations are sufficient for the kinds of collaboration that people usually seek on a public code host, such as experimentation, modification, and sharing as fostered by an open source license.

one don’t have to do anything to not offer a license. one may however wish to add a copyright notice and statement that one are not offering any license in a prominent place (e.g., oner project’s README) so that users don’t assume one made an oversight. If one’re going to accept others’ contributions to oner non-licensed project, one may wish to explore with oner lawyer adding a contributor agreement to oner project so that one maintain copyright permission from contributors, even though one’re not granting the same.

Disallowing use of one's code might not be what one intend by “no license.” An open-source license allows reuse of oner code while retaining copyright. If oner goal is to completely opt-out of copyright restrictions, try a public domain dedication.
